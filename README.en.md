# Não fode, porra!

`Não fode, porra!` is a very cool project with on simple goal: to present in a simple, direct and bluntly data provided by [the Brazilian transparency portal of the Chamber of Deputies](http://www.camara.gov.br/cota-parlamentar/).

This project is **open**, **free** and **cost-free** and has the intention to become a strong and reliable source of information about public expenses from the Brazilian government.

All content available in https://naofodeporra.huehue.eu is generated every day, and derives only from data fetched from `.gov.br` websites. This content is automatically generated by tools that should not present any ideologic or political bias.

## Data Veracity

## Who pays for it?

Everyone. Nobody.

`Não fode, porra!` is an **open**, **free** and **cost-free** project. All content from this project comes from community, in which the members didn't receive any benefits in exchange for their contributions.

All website's infrastructure is 100% cost-free. Our web server is offered by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and all data extraction happens through [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/), both platforms offer cost-free services with which we are being able to develop the whole project.
